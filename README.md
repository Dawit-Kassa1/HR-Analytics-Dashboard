# HR Analytics Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)

An end-to-end **Power BI** dashboard that gives HR leaders an executive view of workforce health and trends. Tracks **headcount, attrition %, average salary, and average age** with drill-through and slicers for self-service analysis. Built as a governed **single source of truth (SSOT)** with a KPI catalog, naming standards, refresh cadence, and documented data lineage.

## Objective
Create a governed HR analytics SSOT in Power BI with standardized KPI definitions, reliable refresh, and clear lineage, so leadership can review trusted workforce insights in minutes, not hours.
